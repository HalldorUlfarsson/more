Here is a [playlist on youtube](https://youtu.be/rDbIMd_5R5k?si=-mhI8jGYSvoaeuU0) with works containing halldorophone, casually maintained by Halldór Úlfarsson. These are works and performances that I am aware of and I am grateful for tips about works floating around youtube which I could add. 

Below are videos of works I have taken part in producing. These are free to share of course and I would appreciate tips about any mention they get.
