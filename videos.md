Here is a [playlist on youtube](https://youtu.be/rDbIMd_5R5k?si=-mhI8jGYSvoaeuU0) with works containing halldorophone, casually maintained by Halldór Úlfarsson. These are works and performances that I am aware of and I am grateful for tips about works floating around youtube which I could add. 

Below are videos of works I have taken part in producing. These are free to share of course and I would appreciate tips about any mention they get.

Collaboration with composer Hlynur Vilmarsson (IS). We built a scaffold for actuators around the instrument which he programmed to perform the music while operating a mixer to the side of the stage for the signal flow in the halldorophone. For Tectonics Festival, 2016 curated by Ilan Volkov.

Collaboration with Composer Johan Svensson (SE), cellist My Hellgren (SE) and electronic musician Jari Suominen (FI). For this project Johan studied the DIMI-A digital synthesizer designed by Finnish inventor Erkki Kurenniemi and devised a notation system for Jari to play from, along with a more conventional, accompanying notation for My to perform his composition for the instruments. The DIMI-A has been housed by the University of Helsinki Music Research Laboratory (UHMRL), where Jari has documented and maintained it for over a decade at the time of filming (along with some of Erkki's other electronic instruments). The work was supported by Kulturkontak Nord (KKN) and the Sibelius Museum in Turku which graciously allowed us to film there) as well as Kai Lassfolk at UHMRL who trusted us with the DIMI-A for the project.
