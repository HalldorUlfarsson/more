Here is a [playlist on youtube](https://youtu.be/rDbIMd_5R5k?si=-mhI8jGYSvoaeuU0) with works containing halldorophone, casually maintained by Halldór Úlfarsson. These are works and performances that I am aware of and I am grateful for tips about works floating around youtube which I could add. 

Below are videos of works I have taken part in producing. These are free to share of course and I would appreciate tips about any mention they get.

Collaboration with composer Hlynur Vilmarsson. We built a scaffold for actuators around the instrument which he programmed to perform the music while operating a mixer to the side of the stage for the signal flow in the halldorophone. For Tectonics Festival, 2016 curated by Ilan Volkov.

Collaboration with composer Hildur Guðnadóttir. Hildur performed a structured improvisations in two venues in and close to Copenhagen which we filmed and edited together to compose the work. Curated by Stine Hebert for the FFKD residency in Copenhagen and supported by the Danish Arts Council.
